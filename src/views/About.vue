                        Hi, I’m Charlotte—founder of <span class="text-primary fw-bold">ImpactHive Marketing.</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After working hands-on with small businesses for over four years in social media management and website design, I saw a clear need: small business owners wanted to grow online, but they were often overwhelmed, underserved, or unsure of where to begin. That’s why I started ImpactHive—to bring clarity, creativity, and strategy to small brands that deserve to be seen and heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What began as a one-woman mission has grown into a close-knit team of digital creatives, strategists, and developers who share a common goal: helping small business owners across the United Kingdom thrive in the digital space. We believe marketing should be purposeful, results-driven, and empowering—not confusing or out of reach.
